## Purpose

I built this project to practice building backend applications that utilize relational databases and building APIs that allow user interaction to the database through CRUD operations. I used mysql through sequelize, and express to build the API.

## Functional Description

This app provides the backend database and interface for an e-commerce platform. The database consists of:
- Product Categories to group products together
- Product Tags to quickly tag relevant data together
- Products
